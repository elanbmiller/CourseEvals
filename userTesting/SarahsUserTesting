Round 1

User: Syrus
Syrus is a humanities student at WashU, and a current senior. He has not taken any engineering courses.

Syrus interacting with the webpage for about five minutes before deciding he'd found all there was to do.


Feedback:
-course sorting was convenient, but he disliked that it only sorted in descending order. He had to scroll to the bottom to see the
highest-rated courses.
-noted that there's no way to get back to the login/opening page once you go to the course view.
-Found a bug with the sort function
-overall he liked the design, but said it needed to be cleaned up. However, he can see the use that students in more technical courses.
-he said that he doesn't really trust course reviews, especially for intro courses. He may use for 300-400 level courses if they were available
for poly sci programs
